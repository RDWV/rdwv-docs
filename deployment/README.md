# Deployment

RedWaves is extremely easy to deploy on your own server!

We have the minimal requirements ever possible:

- 1 GB RAM (2 GB if enabling ETH)
- 10 GB disk
- Unix-based operating systems (something common like ubuntu is recommended)

Please refer to this diagram to choose your deployment method (you can see their descriptions in navigation sidebar at left):

In case you're not yet ready to choose where or how to host (it can cost as little as 3.5$ a month), you can try using RedWaves using [our demo](https://admin.RedWaves.ai) or [third-party hosts](thirdpartyhosting.md).
