# Contribute

RedWaves is built and maintained entirely by volunteer contributors around the internet. We welcome and appreciate new contributions.

If you're a developer looking to help, but you're not sure where to begin, check the [good first issue label](https://github.com/RedWaves/RedWaves/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22), which contains small pieces of work that have been specifically flagged as being friendly to new contributors.

Contributors looking to do something a bit more challenging, before opening a pull request, please [create an issue](https://github.com/RedWaves/RedWaves/issues/new/choose) or join [our community chat](https://t.me/RedWaves) to get early feedback, discuss best ways to tackle the problem and to ensure there is no work duplication.

You can help RedWaves even if you're not a developer.

The easiest way is to use the software as a business or individual, provide feedback and [report any bugs or issues](https://github.com/RedWaves/RedWaves/issues) you or your customers encounter.

Translating RedWaves, helping us with [documentation](https://github.com/RedWaves/RedWaves-docs/issues), making videos, writing articles and spreading the word are ways in which you can help, even if you're not a developer or tech-savvy.

We need more VPS hosting providers to implement 1-Click RedWaves deployment and make the installation of software more accessible, decentralized and widely-available.

We are actively looking for developers who can take on and resolve GitHub issues and help with development. If you would like to help us, but need some guidance, [our community chat](https://t.me/RedWaves) is the place to ask questions. Also, take a look at our [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/RedWaves/RedWaves/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).
